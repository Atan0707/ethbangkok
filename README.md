## What our project is about?

Our Red Light Camera System leverages blockchain to notify drivers instantly if they've been fined, ensuring real-time updates and a transparent record of traffic violations. By integrating blockchain, this system secures all records, offering both drivers and authorities an unalterable and accessible record of fines. It simplifies compliance, enhances trust, and promotes road safety through clear, timely notifications.
